This repo will contain examples of popular Convolutional neural networks implemented in python using Tensorflow framework.

- the first example I have uploaded can be found on kaggle as well for your practice. Here is the link to the [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/arpitjain007/cnn-using-mnist-dataset). However,it is a starter code for understanding the structure of the CNN. I will try to improve the accuracy.
