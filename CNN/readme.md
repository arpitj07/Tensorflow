This repo will contain examples of popular Convolutional neural networks implemented in python.

- the first example I have uploaded can be found on kaggle as well for your practice. Here is the link to the [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/arpitjain007/cnn-using-mnist-dataset). However,it is a starter code for understanding the structure of the CNN. I will try to improve the accuracy.

- The second example I have uploaded is in file `Visualizing CNN.py`. The example gives the idea of how different layers of CNN interpreting the input image and what makes units of layers stimulates the activations.
